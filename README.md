Assignment: Express.js Authentication and State Management
Objective

Develop a server-side web application that demonstrates proficiency in user authentication, session persistence, and client-side state management using signed cookies.
Technical Stack

    Framework: Express.js

    Template Engine: Handlebars (hbs)

    Middleware: express-session, cookie-parser

    Security: Signed Cookies, httpOnly flags

1. Data Structure (Predefined Users)

Do not use a database for this assignment. Instead, define an object in your app.js to store user credentials.

const users = {
    "admin": {
        username: "admin",
        password: "password123",
        fullName: "System Administrator",
        email: "admin@university.edu",
        bio: "Managing the campus network infrastructure."
    },
    "student_dev": {
        username: "student_dev",
        password: "dev_password",
        fullName: "Jane Developer",
        email: "jane.d@student.edu",
        bio: "Full-stack enthusiast and coffee drinker."
    }
};

2. Assignment Requirements
Task A: Authentication Flow

    Login Page: Create a GET /login route that renders a form with username and password fields.

    Logic: Create a POST /login route.

        Verify the credentials against the predefined users object.

        If valid, store the user's data in the session (req.session.user).

        If invalid, redirect back to login with an error message.

    Logout: Implement a GET /logout route that destroys the session and clears the session cookie (connect.sid).

Task B: Protected Profile Route

    Middleware: Write an authentication middleware function to check if req.session.user exists.

    Profile Page: Create a GET /profile route protected by your middleware.

        Render the logged-in user's fullName, email, and bio.

        If a non-authenticated user tries to access this page, redirect them to /login.

Task C: Theme Management (Signed Cookies)

Implement a "Dark/Light Mode" toggle that persists even if the user logs out.

    Route: Create a GET /toggle-theme route.

    Logic: - Check the current value of a cookie named theme.

        Toggle it between light and dark.

        Store the new value as a signed cookie.

        Security Requirement: The cookie MUST be httpOnly: true and signed: true.

    Default: If no cookie exists, the system must default to light mode.

    UI: Use the cookie value to apply a CSS class to the <body> or a container in your main Handlebars layout.

3. Submission Requirements

    Directory Structure:

        /views: .hbs files (login, profile, layout).

        /public: CSS files for light/dark themes.

        app.js: Main server logic.

    Dependencies: Ensure all packages are listed in package.json.

    Secrets: Use a strong secret string for cookie-parser and express-session.
    Attach your github repository for this project onto Canvas Submission.
